This is the repository for the paper "Can you really study an army on the internet? Comparing how status tasks perform in the laboratory and online settings" published in Sociological Methodology. Here, you will find the .qsf file, which you can upload to qualtrics and collect data exactly as we have. You can also access our data management and analysis files (including supplementary analyses).

## Replication files

Replication files are in Stata.

To use, unzip the work file (below) and set your working directory to the work folder. You may need to install a few packages to run the files. For package installation information, see the README file within the work folder. 

If you have any difficulty or would like access to the data cleaning files, please contact me. (We've omitted the cleaning files here since we have at least one more paper that we'd like to publish using them.)
